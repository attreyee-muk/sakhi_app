# Sakhi App

We're developing a user-friendly app to predict PCOS/PCOD, UTI(Urinary Track Infection) and Endometriosis and Post Menopausal Syndrome based on input symptoms. For pre-menopausal users, we estimate menopausal onset and assess post-menopausal concerns like Depression and Loneliness. By considering diverse symptoms, our app aims to detect abnormal hormonal conditions in women by taking the non clinical data, prompting them to seek a medical advice according to their likelihood of getting diagnosed with the medical conditions. We are creating an android application for this with the goal of rolling it out on PlayStore and helping more women.
